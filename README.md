`engine-mode` is a global minor mode for Emacs. It enables you to easily define
search engines, bind them to keybindings, and query them from the comfort of
your editor.

![demo](doc/demo.gif)

For example, suppose we want to be able to easily search GitHub:

```emacs
(defengine github
  "https://github.com/search?ref=simplesearch&q=%s")
```

This defines an interactive function `engine/search-github`. When executed it
will take the selected region (or prompt for input, if no region is selected)
and search GitHub for it, displaying the results in your default browser.

The `defengine` macro can also take an optional key combination, prefixed with
`engine/keymap-prefix` (which defaults to "C-x /"). That keybinding will be
wrapped in a call to `kbd`.

```emacs
(defengine duckduckgo
  "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s"
  :keybinding "d")
```

`C-x / d` is now bound to the new function `engine/search-duckduckgo`! Nifty.

## Installation

`engine-mode` is available on MELPA.

You can also install it like any other elisp file by adding it to your load path
and globally enabling it:

```emacs
(require 'engine-mode)
(engine-mode t)
```

## Changing your default browser

`engine-mode` uses the `engine/browser-function` variable to determine which
browser it should use to open the URL it constructs. To change the default
browser, redefine `engine/browser-function`. For example, to always use Emacs'
built-in `eww` browser:

```emacs
(setq engine/browser-function 'eww-browse-url)
```

`engine/browser-function` defaults to `browse-url-browser-function`, which Emacs
uses globally to open links.

The implementation of the `browse-url-browser-function` variable contains a
comprehensive list of possible browser functions. You can get to that by hitting
`C-h v browser-url-browser-function <RETURN>` and following the link to
`browse-url.el`.

## Changing your browser on a per-engine basis

To only change the browser for a single engine, use the `:browser` keyword
argument when you define the engine. For example, to use `eww` only for your
GitHub search results, try:

```emacs
(defengine github
  "https://github.com/search?ref=simplesearch&q=%s"
  :browser 'eww-browse-url)
```

As mentioned about, see the implementation of the `browse-url-browser-function`
for a definitive list of browsers.

## Changing the keymap prefix

The default keymap prefix for `engine-mode` is `C-x /`. If you'd like to bind
the keymap to an additional prefix (say, `C-c s`), you totally can:

```emacs
(engine/set-keymap-prefix (kbd "C-c s"))
```

## Custom docstrings

`defengine` assigns each engine a reasonable default docstring, but you can
override that on a case-by-case basis with the `:docstring` keyword argument:

```emacs
(defengine ctan
  "http://www.ctan.org/search/?x=1&PORTAL=on&phrase=%s"
  :docstring "Search the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (ctan.org)")
```

## Modifying the search term before sending it

An engine might want to transform a search term in some way before it
interpolates the term into the URL. Maybe the term should have a different
encoding, or be capitalized differently, or, uh, be passed through [ROT13].
Whatever the reason, you can apply a custom transformation to a search term by
passing a function to `defengine` through the `:term-transformation-hook`
keyword argument.

For example, to UPCASE all of your DuckDuckGo searches:

```emacs
(defengine duckduckgo
  "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s"
  :term-transformation-hook 'upcase)
```

Or, to ensure that all your queries are encoded as latin-1:

```emacs
(defengine diec2
  "dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=%s"
  :term-transformation-hook (lambda (term) (encode-coding-string term latin-1))
  :keybinding "c")
```

## Importing keyword searches from other browsers

Since many browsers save keyword searches using the same format as engine-mode
(that is, by using `%s` in a url to indicate a search term), it's not too hard
to import them into Emacs.

[@sshaw] has written a script to [import from Chrome on OS X]. Thanks for that!

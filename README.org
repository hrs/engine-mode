~engine-mode~ is a global minor mode for Emacs. It enables you to easily define
search engines, bind them to keybindings, and query them from the comfort of
your editor.

For example, suppose we want to be able to easily search GitHub:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defengine github
    "https://github.com/search?ref=simplesearch&q=%s")
#+end_src

This defines an interactive function ~engine/search-github~. When executed it will
take the selected region (or prompt for input, if no region is selected) and
search GitHub for it, displaying the results in your default browser.

The ~defengine~ macro can also take an optional key combination, prefixed with
~engine/keymap-prefix~ (which defaults to =C-x /=). That keybinding will be wrapped
in a call to ~kbd~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defengine duckduckgo
    "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s"
    :keybinding "d")
#+end_src

=C-x / d= is now bound to the new function ~engine/search-duckduckgo~! Nifty.

** Installation

~engine-mode~ is available on MELPA.

Using ~use-package~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package engine-mode
    :ensure t

    :config
    (engine-mode t))
#+end_src

You can also install it like any other elisp file by adding it to your load path
and globally enabling it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'engine-mode)
  (engine-mode t)
#+end_src

** Changing your default browser

~engine-mode~ uses the ~engine/browser-function~ variable to determine which browser
it should use to open the URL it constructs. To change the default browser,
redefine ~engine/browser-function~. For example, to always use Emacs' built-in ~eww~
browser:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq engine/browser-function 'eww-browse-url)
#+end_src

~engine/browser-function~ defaults to ~browse-url-browser-function~, which Emacs
uses globally to open links.

The implementation of the ~browse-url-browser-function~ variable contains a
comprehensive list of possible browser functions. You can get to that by hitting
=C-h v browse-url-browser-function <RETURN>= and following the link to
=browse-url.el=.

** Changing your browser on a per-engine basis

To only change the browser for a single engine, use the ~:browser~ keyword
argument when you define the engine. For example, to use ~eww~ only for your
GitHub search results, try:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defengine github
    "https://github.com/search?ref=simplesearch&q=%s"
    :browser 'eww-browse-url)
#+end_src

As mentioned about, see the implementation of the ~browse-url-browser-function~
for a definitive list of browsers.

** Changing the keymap prefix

The default keymap prefix for ~engine-mode~ is =C-x /=. If you'd like to bind
the keymap to an additional prefix (say, =C-c s=), you totally can:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (engine/set-keymap-prefix (kbd "C-c s"))
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, you can achieve the same thing with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  :bind-keymap ("C-c s" . engine-mode-prefixed-map)
#+end_src

** Custom docstrings

~defengine~ assigns each engine a reasonable default docstring, but you can
override that on a case-by-case basis with the ~:docstring~ keyword argument:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defengine ctan
    "https://www.ctan.org/search/?x=1&PORTAL=on&phrase=%s"
    :docstring "Search the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (ctan.org)")
#+end_src

** Modifying the search term before sending it

An engine might want to transform a search term in some way before it
interpolates the term into the URL. Maybe the term should have a different
encoding, or be capitalized differently, or, uh, be passed through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13][ROT13]].
Whatever the reason, you can apply a custom transformation to a search term by
passing a function to ~defengine~ through the ~:term-transformation-hook~ keyword
argument.

For example, to UPCASE all of your DuckDuckGo searches:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defengine duckduckgo
    "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s"
    :term-transformation-hook upcase)
#+end_src

Or, to ensure that all your queries are encoded as latin-1:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defengine diec2
    "dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=%s"
    :term-transformation-hook (lambda (term) (encode-coding-string term latin-1))
    :keybinding "c")
#+end_src

You could also use a ~:term-transformation-hook~ to make an engine behave
differently when given a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Prefix-Command-Arguments.html][prefix argument]] (i.e. typing =C-u= before invoking the
engine).

Some search engines support querying for exact phrases by enclosing the search
string with double quotes. Transformations could be useful in this case to
perform a literal search instead if the universal argument is present:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defengine duckduckgo
    "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s"
    :term-transformation-hook (lambda (term) (if current-prefix-arg
                                            (concat "\"" term "\"")
                                          term))
    :keybinding "d")
#+end_src

Typing =C-x / d= will perform a regular search, but typing =C-u C-x / d= will
wrap your query in quotes before searching for it. That's especially useful when
searching for the contents of the region.

** Importing keyword searches from other browsers

Since many browsers save keyword searches using the same format as engine-mode
(that is, by using ~%s~ in a url to indicate a search term), it's not too hard to
import them into Emacs.

[[https://github.com/sshaw][@sshaw]] has written a script to [[https://gist.github.com/sshaw/9b635eabde582ebec442][import from Chrome on OS X]]. Thanks for that!

** Comparison with =webjump=

Emacs has a perfectly lovely built-in =webjump= package which allows the user to
define a set of URLs, interpolate search terms into them, and visit them in the
browser.

Why might you use =engine-mode= instead of =webjump=?

- You want to bind specific searches to keybindings. Because =engine-mode= defines
  a function for each engine, keybindings in =engine-mode= can be associated
  directly with specific searches.
- You'd like to associate browser functions with engines on a case-by-case
  basis. For example, if you want to perform some searches in Firefox, and other
  searches in =eww=, that's trivial in =engine-mode=.
- You like some of =engine-mode='s minor UI conveniences. If you've got a region
  selected, for example, =engine-mode= will use that as the search query, while
  =webjump= will ignore it and offer an empty prompt.

If you're not interested in these features, =webjump= is a great choice! Honestly,
the author of =engine-mode= probably wouldn't have bothered writing it if they'd
known =webjump= existed at the time. :sweat_smile:

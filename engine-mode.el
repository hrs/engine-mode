;;; engine-mode.el --- Define and query search engines from within Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; `engine-mode' is a global minor mode for Emacs. It enables you to
;; easily define search engines, bind them to keybindings, and query
;; them from the comfort of your editor.

;; For example, suppose we want to be able to easily search GitHub:

;; (defengine github
;;   "https://github.com/search?ref=simplesearch&q=%s")

;; This defines an interactive function `engine/search-github'. When
;; executed it will take the selected region (or prompt for input, if
;; no region is selected) and search GitHub for it, displaying the
;; results in your default browser.

;; The `defengine' macro can also take an optional key combination:

;; (defengine duckduckgo
;;   "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s"
;;   "C-c / d")

;; `C-c / d' is now bound to the new function
;; engine/search-duckduckgo'! Nifty.

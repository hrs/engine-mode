;;; engine-mode.el --- Define and query search engines from within Emacs.

;; Author: Harry R. Schwartz <hello@harryrschwartz.com>
;; Version: 2.1.0
;; URL: https://github.com/hrs/engine-mode
;; Package-Requires: ((cl-lib "0.5"))

;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; `engine-mode' is a global minor mode for Emacs. It enables you to
;; easily define search engines, bind them to keybindings, and query
;; them from the comfort of your editor.

;; For example, suppose we want to be able to easily search GitHub:

;; (defengine github
;;   "https://github.com/search?ref=simplesearch&q=%s")

;; This defines an interactive function `engine/search-github'. When
;; executed it will take the selected region (or prompt for input, if
;; no region is selected) and search GitHub for it, displaying the
;; results in your default browser.

;; The `defengine' macro can also take an optional key combination,
;; prefixed with "C-x /":

;; (defengine duckduckgo
;;   "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s"
;;   :keybinding "d")

;; `C-x / d' is now bound to the new function
;; engine/search-duckduckgo'! Nifty.

  "Define a custom search engine.

`engine-name' is a symbol naming the engine.
`search-engine-url' is the url to be queried, with a \"%s\"
standing in for the search term.
The optional keyword argument `docstring' assigns a docstring to
the generated function. A reasonably sensible docstring will be
generated if a custom one isn't provided.
The optional keyword argument `browser` assigns the browser
function to be used when opening the URL.
The optional keyword argument `term-transformation-hook' is a
function that will be applied to the search term before it's
substituted into `search-engine-url'. For example, if we wanted
to always upcase our search terms, we might use:

(defengine duckduckgo
  \"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s\"
  :term-transformation-hook 'upcase)

In this case, searching for \"foobar\" will hit the url
\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=FOOBAR\".

The optional keyword argument `keybinding' is a string describing
the key to bind the new function.

Keybindings are in the `engine-mode-map', so they're prefixed.

For example, to search Wikipedia, use:

  (defengine wikipedia
    \"http://www.wikipedia.org/search-redirect.php?language=en&go=Go&search=%s\"
    :keybinding \"w\"
    :docstring \"Search Wikipedia!\")

Hitting \"C-x / w\" will be bound to the newly-defined
`engine/search-wikipedia' function."
